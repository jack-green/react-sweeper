# Reactsweeper

Re-live that sweet Windows 95 Minesweeper nostalgia in high-def React / Typescript / JSS.

## Why?

I hadn't built anything using css-in-js yet, so I thought I'd make something silly.

## Developing

run `react start` to fire up a local version at http://localhost:3000 with live reloading and all that sweet create-react-app goodness.

## Building

Run `react build` to smush that javascript, shake those trees and create a nicely packaged app in `/build`.

## Testing

One day i'll write some tests, this wasn't about that.
